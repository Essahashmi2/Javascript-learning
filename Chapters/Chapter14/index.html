    <p>This program uses two requirements to check a person's eligibility to ride the rides in an amusement park. The two requirements are that you cannot be less than 15 years old or shorter than 145cm. When you enter your age and height, the program tells you whether you can ride in the amusement park or not. If you cannot, it specifies which requirements you did not meet, age, height or both </p>
